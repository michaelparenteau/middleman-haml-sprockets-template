# mm-haml
Minimal HAML template with sprockets for middlemanapp (4.0.0)

Includes:

* middleman-jquery
* Compass
* Susy 2
* Breakpoint

This is a very simple starter. Created so I can use the `-T` flag in
the new middleman 4 `init` command. Since having custom templates in
.middleman directory locally is no longer supported.. I have to put this
here.

Tested on Ruby 2.3.0

```
gem install bundler
gem install middleman
middleman init -T [project-name] michaelparenteau/mm-haml
```
